\maketitle

\verb=gitTraverse= is a poorly named Python script with the eventual goal of automating
the task of making timelapse videos for a document that has been made using \LaTeX and
\verb=Git=.

Currently, you run the script a \verb=.tex= file. The script will traverse your git 
history (from branch master) and create PDFs from the named \verb=.tex= file at
each commit. This is ugly but it's the first step towards our eventual goal.
